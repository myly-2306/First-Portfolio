# First-Portfolio

## Animation and Web developer

This is my first portfolio as a novice. I tried to apply what I've learned so far to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and my ability to execute and duplicate command lines in return for my satisfication.

However, in the work section, you can still see an imperfection due to my lack of experienced CSS skills. If you resize the screen, the small pictures won't be responsive. They go down below the big picture but won't stack on each other like the way I wish.  

Also, in the work section, there are 5 appliactions but only one is real. I will replace them as soon as I build more projects.

There are 2 links anchored in my page. If you click on the Hungry Cat, it'll take you to a simple game I created using Slack. I also provide my Github profile in the contact section.
